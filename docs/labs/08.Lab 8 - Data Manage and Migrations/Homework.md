# Homework 4: Data Manage and Migrations

## Homework Assignment

- update you domain classes with Code first conventions. Be careful with nullable properties - set "?" on type where you expect null value from database. Implement connections between classes (tables) using (reverse) navigation properties and foreign keys (IDs). Think about it (figure out which connection you need) and research all connections (1-1, 1-N and N-N).
- implement configuration file for each domain class. In config file is not necessary to implement all rules (because some of them are already defined with conventions), but you can do it for first time because it will not cause a problem if you have more than necessary.
- implement Program.cs file with connection string map and block of code to achieve migrations.
- start migrations via Package Manager Console
