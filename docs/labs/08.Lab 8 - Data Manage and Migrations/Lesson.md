**ASP.NET** framework provides developer with build in DI container in which developer can define custom services with one of three lifetime scopes:

- **Singleton:** lifetime of service is through lifetime of application
- **Scoped:** lifetime of service is scope of one request, so for each request new service will be created
- **Transient:** each time service is requested, new instance is created
