## **Exercise 1: Creating GitHub Repository**

To create remote repository on github first go to your account or organization (ex: <https://github.com/fesb-distributed-systems-2024> )
and press Create a new repository button (<https://github.com/organizations/fesb-distributed-systems-2024/repositories/new> )

![github-organization](./github-organization.png)

Repository name should follow pattern: `{your-username}-lab-{lab-number}` (ex: `ipazanin-lab-01`) for lab exercises and `{your-username}-hw-{hw-number}` (ex: `ipazanin-hw-01`) for homework assignments.

If the repository is not a part of lab practice: `{your-username}-{project-name}` (ex: `nknezovic-mothers-project`)

Description is optional, **repository must be PRIVATE**, and finally initialize repository by adding README file, adding .gitignore (VisualStudio).

## **Exercise 2: Cloning Remote Git Repository**

To clone remote repository go to created repository on github and press Code > SSH and copy contents.

![github-clone-ssh](./github-clone-ssh.png)

Open terminal on desired file system location and use command:

`git-clone {your-repository}` (ex: `git-clone git@github.com:fesb-distributed-systems-2021/ipazanin-lab-01.git`)

and now you can open cloned repository with Visual Studio Code using:
`code {your-repository-name}` (ex: `code ipazanin-lab-01`)

![vscode-project](./vscode-project.png)

You can learn more about .gitignore file on link <https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore>

## **Exercise 3: Adding, Committing and Pushing Code to Remote Repository**

If you have previously created a project, you can copy and paste it to the repository folder or you can start creating a new project in the git folder.

To check status of your project, open terminal in repository folder and use commands:

```shell
git status
```

![git-status](./git-status.png)

Tells me I have one un-staged file changed (README.md)

Once you are satisfied with your code changes, you must commit them.

The process of permanently "saving" changes is divided into 3 steps:

### **Step 1 - Stage Changes**
   - This step groups selected changes and prepares them for *commiting* i.e. "saving"
   - Staging can be repeated many times

To stage changes, use command:

```shell
git add {file1} {file2} ... {fileN}
```

To *stage* files: *file1, file2, ..., fileN*.

:::info **NOTE**

The staging is not limited to files, you can stage folders also.

:::

Or more concisely:

```shell
git add .
```

To stage all files (`.` means *this* directory i.e. the whole project).

![git-stage-files](./git-stage-files.png)

### **Step 2 - Commit All Changes**
   - Commits groups **staged** files into a unit

:::caution **IMPORTANT**

**Commits are the basic unit of change in Git** i.e. you can undo or redo code changes by undoing or redoing specific *commits*.

:::

To commit *staged* changes, use command:

```shell
git commit -m "{your-commit-message}"
```

Where `{your-commit-message}` is a short message describing changes you made to the code in this *commit* e.g.

```shell
git commit -m "Added a new button to print the report as PDF."
```

![git-commit](./git-commit.png)

### **Step 3 - Push Changes to the Remote Repository**
   - Git (specifically `git clone <repo-url>`) works by creating a **copy** of a remote repository located at `<repo-url>` e.g. on GitHub.
   - All changes *stashed* and *commited* are only visible **only** on the copy (called the local repository) of the remote repository.

To apply changes from the local repository (located on the PC) to the remote repository (located on the GitHub) use:

```shell
git push
```

![git-push](./git-push.png)

Message notifies we donâ€™t have branch named development on remote repository (GitHub) so we must use to create it:

```shell
git push --set-upstream origin development
```

Now, all chages will be visible on the remote repository on GitHub.


## **Exercise 4: Branching and Merging**

![git-branch](./git-branch.png)

A **branch** is a line of *commits* i.e. a line of changes to the code. A *branch* can point to any *commit* meaning all *commits* from the beginning up to selected *commit* will be applied which means that we can effectively undo changes (*commits*) in code and/or apply changes (*commits*) by changing to which *commit* the *branch* points.

### **Visualize Branches**

To visualize branches, use command:
```shell
gitk --all
```

which opens the following window:
![gitk-all](./gitk-all.PNG)

The window contains a lot of information which is divided into 3 sections:
![gitk-all-annotated](./gitk-all-annotated.PNG)

- 1 - Branches and Commits
  - 1a - Green rectangles = commits
  - 1b - A list of commits
- 2 - A list of files changed since the last commit
- 3 - A line-by-line list of changes for the selected file in panel 2

To change the commit to which the branch points, right-click on the target commit and select `Reset <branch> to here` which will effectively revert all the changes made after the selected commit.

![gitk-revert-commit](./gitk-revert-commit.png)

### **Creating a New Branch**

Code development is never done on the main branch (you can checkout to the new branch while having changes).
To create new branch and change git to that branch use:

`git checkout -b {your-branch-name}`
(ex: `git checkout -b development`)

Until you know what you are doing, I recommend doing development on branch `development`.

```shell
git status
```

![git-checkout-branch](./git-checkout-branch.png)

After making changes on the `development` branch, *stash, commit* and *push* the changes from the `development` branch to the remote repository, as described in  [Exercise 3: Adding, Committing and Pushing Code to Remote Repository](#exercise-3-adding-committing-and-pushing-code-to-remote-repository)


### **Creating Pull Request**

Once you are satisfied with code on your `development` branch, you can create **pull request** (PR) on the `main` branch.

Pull requests will merge changes to the main branch to sync their code.

On GitHub navigate to page Pull request in your repository.

![github-pull-request-page](github-pull-request-page.png)

And create new pull request by pressing new pull request.

![github-create-pull-request](./github-create-pull-request.png)

![github-pull-request-changes](./github-pull-request-changes.png)

Before you finish creating pull requests, add **pkaselj** as reviewer. (**NOT nknezovic** as in picture below)

![github-pull-request-reviewer](./github-pull-request-reviewer.png)

**AFTER pkaselj** has approved your pull request, you can merge it using button.

![github-pull-request-approve](./github-pull-request-approve.png)

Merge pull request.

To fetch changes on main branch locally, checkout to main branch in your terminal and:

```shell
git checkout main
git pull
git status
```

![git-pull-changes](./git-pull-changes.png)

And you will see changes done on development branch now on main branch.

:::tip **NOTES**

When you get a comment on your pull request, you should correct your code accordingly and push a new commit to the remote branch using the same commands as described before.

:::

## **Exercise 5: Tags**

At some point in time, the project i.e. the code is stable. By implementing changes, the project changes - may become unstable, may not work on some platform etc.

We want to mark some *commits* so we can easily find them when we need the code from project from a specific point in time. To mark a commmit we **tag** it in git.

When we want to tag the current commit, we use:
```shell
git tag {tag-name}
```

e.g.

```shell
git tag 2024-0.0.0
```

![gitk-tag](./gitk-tag.PNG)

We can *checkout* *tags* in the same way as we checkout *branches*:

```shell
git checkout 2024-0.0.0
```

:::tip **NOTE**

The general convention i.e. best practice is to name tags in the form of `Maj.Min.Pch`
where:
  - `Maj` - *Version major number* for major changes which break compatibility with older versions
  - `Min` - *Version minor number* for minor changes that (generally) do not break compatibility with older versions
  - `Pch` - *Version patch number* for bug fixes
e.g.
```shell
git tag 2.1.0
```
